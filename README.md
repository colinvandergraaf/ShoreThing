# ShoreThing

Shore Thing checks the air quality (AQI) and weather (temperature and status, i.e. sunny, cloudy, etc.) of your zipcode, as well as for every public beach nearby.

After you signup with an account, your preferred/home zipcode will be stored in our database, but you can always search for other zipcodes.

Shore Thing will display beaches close to your zipcode, and you can add these beaches to your favorites list, also stored in our database.  You can also keep track of how many times you've visited each beach!
